<h1>Isotope (in React)</h1>
<p>
I was asked on April 12, 2016 to implement the <a href="http://isotope.metafizzy.co/">isotope jQuery plugin</a> using ReactJS.
Initially I thought it to be quite difficult since I had not done much if any ReactJS.

It's always a little tough starting out when you don't know a technology and have to build something with it. However, if you take the "break it down to smaller pieces" approach to problem solving then it actually becomes manageable.


I've created a simple form to add an element to a table. You can also filter and sort by different attributes.

<h2>Stumbling points</h2>
* Needing to learn ReactJS quickly
* Brushing up on animations more
* Setting up a ReactJS dev environment
* Organizing ReactJS code

<h2>Improvements</h2>
~~* Not sure why I was naming things with "atom", change it to "element"~~
* Update splash page with something nicer
~~* Update form to remove color option, add color with element type~~
* Experiment with different form layout
* Add update/delete element

<h2>Install</h2>
Global:
Node
Webpack, Webpack-cli

```
$> npm install
$> npm start
```

Go to http://localhost:8080 and the landing/splash page should show up.
